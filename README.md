# Simple Pyhton App to track household movies (DVD / Blu-Ray)

During my time with my previous employer, I always aspired to transition into their DevOps/Cloud team to gain hands-on experience in that domain. Unfortunately, it never materialized.

To pursue this interest independently, I developed a small Python application (BETA v1.0) to track all the movies scattered across my home. The project allowed me to simulate real DevOps activities and explore open-source tools to create a basic DevOps environment. The diagram below illustrates a simplified aspect of my approach, with source code to follow (https://github.com/hpilon/movieapps) at some near future date.
